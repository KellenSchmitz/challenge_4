## Overview of the school district analysis:
The School Board requested a review of the students' passing reading and math scores on by school, grade level, school type and size to determine if any relationships existed.

The School Board has found evidence that academic dishonesty may have occurred at Thomas High School concerning 9th grader math and reading scores. The Board requested that Thomas High School's 9th grader scores be removed from the district wide analysis.

## Results:
The following bullets highlight the main findings by removing the suspect scores from Thomas High School 9th graders.

- How is the district summary affected? - Very small impact, with the most notable on % overall passing (reducing it from 65.2% to 64.9%)
- How is the school summary affected? - no meaningful change 
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools? - school ranking did not change, with Thomas High School staying in second

  - Scores by school spending - no meaningful change
  - Scores by school size - no meaningful change
